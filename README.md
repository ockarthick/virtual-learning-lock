# Virtual Learning Lock
Virtual Learning Lock is a simple Windows application to lock the mouse &amp; keyboard. 

## Why do you need it?
Due to COVID-19, our elementary school-age kid attends video lessons over Google Meet or Zoom. 

My wife noticed that staying focused on the lesson was challenging for our kid, when there are a myriad of distractions on screen - opening new tabs, browsing YouTube etc. without the teacher knowing.

So she came up with the idea of this simple mouse & keyboard lock, to allow the video lessons play and discourage other computer usage on the side. And I was tasked with building it.

## How do I use it?
### In short:
- To lock the keyboard and mouse, just run the application from Start Menu.
- To unlock, type the preset password "opensesame".

### More details:
First, install VirtualLearningLockSetup.exe from the Releases tab on the right of this page. Then, whenever your kid has a virtual lesson and need to pay attention to, follow these steps:

1. Have your kid to join their virtual classroom/Google Meet/Zoom call.
2. Once your screen has the video call in the right position, run "Virtual Learning Lock" from the Start Menu. This should show a flash on screen and create a button on the taskbar showing "Learning Lock On".
3. Your mouse and keyboard are now locked. Your child can move the mouse, but clicks or key presses wouldn't do anything.
4. To unlock, type in the preset password "opensesame". This should show a flash on screen and the above mentioned taskbar button should go away.

In case you are unable to unlock for any reason, you can always use one of these failsafe steps:
- Ctrl+Alt+Del, select Log Off, and log back in, or
- Press the power button for 10 seconds so the computer shuts down and you can restart it
